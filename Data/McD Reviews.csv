1,"It'd McDonalds. It is what it is as far as the food and atmosphere go. The staff here does make a difference. They are all friendly, accommodating and always smiling. Makes for a more pleasant experience than many other fast food places.",Positive 
2,"I repeat my order 3 times in the drive thru, and she still manage to mess it up , it was suppose to be a large meal double filet of fish with large fries , no cheese . It was all wrong , they either need to pay close attention to the order being made , understand English or they need not to work at a drive thru",Negative
3,I work for door dash and they locked us all out to wait in a long line for no reason at 10. I tried to beg them to open it because I'm door dash and they refused.  Covid is over get a new job,Negative
4,"If I  could give this location a zero on customer service, I  would. Pulled into drive through at 8:07 and placed a simple order. I order a regular hamburg and cookies. Once I paid and pulled up to the window to pick up, I  was told to pull up to the #1 space. I sat there and sat there and.........25 minutes later, no order. I  went in and no one was at the counter. I yelled ""hello"" three times. A young lady came up asking who was handling the front counter. A young girl appeared. To make this complaint shorter, I  showed my receipt and another 5 minutes later I got my order. There was another order with a drink sitting on the counter that never got to the person who ordered it. After getting home, I  had no regular hamburg but had cookies. Everyone, don't even bother going to this location again. It's a horrible experience every time as you can see by other reviews.",Negative
5,Went thru drive thru. Ordered. Getting home noticed my 10 piece nuggets where missing. Tried calling the restaurant and nothing. The lady gave me a hard time about extra sauce. Very unhappy .....,Negative
6,"We stopped by for a quick breakfast.  It was not crowded inside, but there was a pretty long drive thru.

Our order was supposed to have 3 food items and 2 drinks. They missed a food item. The lady ignored me when I told her.

My husband went to get it, she finished her task then handed it to him without a word or smile or anything.",Negative
7,"The morning crew seems fast and efficient. Night crew is a whole different experience, lines down the street, hour long waits. If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn't be so bad but this is a nightly problem. Beyond this the staff is so highly rude you leave wanting to crash your car through the building. Don't forget they will mistake your order almost every single time as well and serve it to you cold.",Negative
8,"Today, i was disappointed in that restaurant #11853 did not get me my FULL order, meaning I did not receive my condiments for my big breakfast with hot cakes. No butter, no syrup, and no utensils. Luckily this was a hiccup and not a regular thing. Oh, and the egg was half the size of the sausage.",Neutral
9,"Ordered food burger wrong and left out part of the order also. One of the drink cup lid not fattened. Poor service girl handing order at window on January 7, 2023 at 1pm.",Negative
10,This was a dine in experience. The tables were all dirty & we did not get our food after waiting 35 minutes. Chicken sandwich was burnt.,Negative
11,"The line wS extremely big and was moving very slowly, plus they were out of apple pies and strawberry cream pies, but they gave me substitute cinnabun, the staff was very apologetic for being slow & they were out of pies, but it was middle of the night and they were extremely under-staffed.",Positive 
12,The boy who attended me made me wait and when he saw that the drink was wrong he threw the bag of food at me with a grimace. So disappointed!,Negative
13,The staff seems to always be different which makes ordering sometimes a little difficult because they are in a state of perpetual learning which can also lead to waiting a bit longer but the lobby is always clean as well as the bathrooms,Positive 
14,"Can't believe experience with order taker. Went from drive thru and employee directly asks what do you want. He keeps rushing while taking order with no other cars placing order. We wanted to add one more item and asked for a minute. He keeps asking what else. When I said we are ready - no response. There were no other car placing order that time either. I told again we are ready. responded after a pause. Again what do you want... excuse me.. who talks to customers like this ??
I asked for his name to put a review and he flat out denied. I asked for receipt before handing my credit card. He swipes it and returns back my card. I m waiting for a receipt with my family in the car. He starts inputing another order on his tablet. Waited for sometime and then I waive my hand several times. He opens window and said you can get receipt from next window. Excuse me ??
Went to next window - picked up food, asked for Manager and got his name JAMAR. My receipt states 08/06/2022 7:20pm Order 05
I didn't want to complain but this was intolerable.",Negative
15,"Meh.. just meh. When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.",Negative
16,Just needed caffeine. The staff at the drive thru just shoved the drink in my hands. Not very professional.,Negative
17,"This is consistently the worst meal you will pay for. Microwaved nuggets, cold fries and a 30 minute wait. What more can you ask for? Dont go here ever! Your better off going hungry or giving the meal you payed for to the homeless by the donation box behind the drive thru.",Negative
18,With all the new upgrades everything looks great and clean great staff,Positive 
19,Yet another McDonald's with horrible service and lazy employees. I mean c'mon do they intentionally hire unqualified people???,Negative
20,(Sarcasm) this was exactly what I ordered! A 20 minute wait in the drive through for a room temperature caramel mocha that was less than 2/3 full!,Negative
21,"This location is wack.
They will literally stop taking orders and make people sit in the parking lot for like 12 minutes until 3:00 a.m. so that they don't get to order dinner food anymore.
We have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the Drive-Thru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over.
Look McDonald's if I wanted a breakfast deluxe I wouldn't have shown up at 2:30 in the morning thank you.",Negative
22,They did not honor there advertised price. This is extra pickles.,Negative
23,"Just spent 10 minutes waiting at this McDonald's . According to Google they're open 24/7. Finally we pull up to the window to see if anyone was there, sure enough one employee seated in the lobby and another at the window. She told me they were closed. Whoever these two are they need to be replaced. Get it together McDonald's. You're a corporate power house and you have a reputation to keep. One of the most unprofessional experiences I've ever had with fast food. 0/10 would not recomend this location.",Negative
24,The staff are very friendly and they do their job perfectly,Positive 
25,Awesome service! Food hot!  Best ever,Positive 
26,"This is the WORST McDonald's EVER, I don't come here often because when I do my order is wrong EVERY TIME.  Today 2/25/22 1130am 1 the drive thru person could barely hear me and I was almost yelling 2 I get to the next window after paying and I'm asked what did you order?? I tell them at the end of me repeating my order I now have your entire staff looking CONFUSED AS HELL like I just dropped outta the sky now I'm being asked did I pay? Are you sure you ordered at the speaker? Now all of ya'll wear head sets except for the cooks the worst leadership I've ever seen",Negative
27,"Me and my girlfriend came tonight to pick up our food after 11pm for a mobile order, they need a better system if you are walking on foot. The food tasted great, loved the McDonald's deal ordering from the app.",Neutral
28,"Been frequenting this location for a few years.Morning,mid-day and night,the food is always hot,fresh and served with a smile.",Positive 
29,The drinks were watered down and the employee was downright rude when asked to replace the drinks.!!,Negative
30,"I ordered a Large fry buy after arriving to my destination I saw they did not fill the carton up.  They gave me a small portion for what I paid for.  This is not right and management needs to correct this.  Stealing from customers is plain wrong.  When ordering a large, they expect to get what should come in a large.  I noticed after my bad experience that your reviews are low.  In order order to create a good business, giving people an exceptional experience should be your goal not the opposite.",Negative
31,Will not answer my call. Messed up my order 4times in and hour!,Negative
32,Slow always have wait for my food and have to go back in to get it fixed.  No one ever iles or has a none fake smile. No welcome to McDonald's or have a great day especially in drive through . And if you do say something's wrong you get a major attitude especially from the shift manager guy tall black guy .  ( Sorry don't know his name ),Negative
33,"Normally this location does pretty good, but last night was absolutely ridiculous. I sat in the drive thru for almost an hour waiting to get my order taken, the line was wrapped almost TWICE around the building, and finally I gave up and tried driving up to the window to give them my order since i was next in line. When i got to the window, they told me they couldn't take it and I'd have to go back around. I told them I'd like to put in my order here since I've been waiting all this time, and they proceeded to still refuse and that it's my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out. The second lane was open, and the ""sign"" they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive-thru menu. I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me, and then slammed the drive thru window shut. I've never received such deplorable customer service in my life, and if any managers are reading this, I highly suggest firing the two workers from last night.",Negative
34,"Rude customer service, unprofessional attitude, overcooked food, no complimentary items for screwing up our orders. I don't understand how you can keep your job when there is so many negative reviews. I vow to never eat here again. I would rather eat a cold can of baked beans...",Negative
35,"Representative was very rude and disrespectful,  refused fulfilling my order and simply hung up on me on the drive through window... never was I so disappointed at that location before. Manager pretended like nothing even happened.",Negative
36,They got our order correct and didn't cut me off before I had finished ordering our food at the speaker. I could actually understand our order taker. I don't know if it really gets any better than that at a fast food place anymore.,Neutral
37,Good quick drive through service.  Was a long line but went very quickly.,Positive 
38,I go here all the time. Great staff.. NVR get my food wrong it's just always a line wrapped around lol that's why they ain't 5 stars. Most def customer service is better then the food but hey I just go for my kids because they love it so why not! Good customer service guys! Makes all the difference,Positive 
39,I went to pick up food from the restaurant at late night through drive through. I was told to wait near the door and I will be getting the order but even after waiting 15 minutes no one came with the food. Orders are already assigned and even after coming through drive through it takes more than half an hour to get it which is not good. Lots of people behind me got the food but no one cared about the driver who is already waiting from long time. Thank you,Negative
40,"OPEN 24HRS all the darn time!!  If there are 24 hours in every day and then 7 days in a week then that means this place is open eleventeen million hours a year.  I dont even know how they find people to work here I mean how do they shower or brush their teeth or change clothes if they are always there.... I think I may have an idea: they are robots.  Or clones, like this example that's Dolly the sheep she's pretty hot NGL.",Positive 
41,"It was late, order was wrong, person taking order needs to slow down,",Positive 
42,"The manager IS RUDE at 13749 183 research Blvd.in north Austin TX. HAD TO GO BACK INTO THE  DINER  3 TIMES AND THE 3RD TIME THE MANAGER DIDNT EVEN ACKOWLEDGE WE WERE EVEN THERE.. DISCRIPTION OF SAID MANAGER SPANISH ABOUT 5 FT TALL AND HAD LONG BLONDOISH HAIR PULLED BACK INTO A PONY TAIL. READ PREVIOUS REVIEWS AND THRY WERE NOT GOOD
NEED TO CHECK OUT WHAT IS GOING ON .",Negative
43,Never would come back here again my mother was asking for a coke and the lady became rude and said to her coworker in Spanish omg this fat women it hurt me that she said that and we know what she said so teach your employees how to speck properly in front of people,Negative
44,"Never gotten my order wrong, employees seem to change a lot but they're consistently quick and nice. Also the prices here are lower than other locations, I don't know why but its a total welcome change haha.",Positive 
45,They run out of fry containers and constantly forget sauces. The dining room is still closed for some reason so have fun getting back in line for a sauce. Sometimes the fries aren't great which is a huge part of McDonald's. Come on guys...,Neutral
46,They get an extra Star because their staff 8 of 10 have been polite. Drive through has issues. They constantly get order wrong. Ask you to pull forward to fix and leave you hanging. I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes. They are new. I understand training new people. But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat 3 times to make sure they get it right. Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket. Not just a quarter pounder. Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes. Their tea as of late has tasted like dish soap and their fountain drinks have a funky taste to them. Numerous times their fries have been under cooked.,Negative
47,"McDonald's is usually pretty bad about inventory shorts especially.
The BBQ sauce, it's just a conspiracy but if you ever been a lover of Mcys Nuggets then you know they tend to ""Forget"" the BBQ sauce. Any other sauce and it's in there. But overall I dont see my self going back anytime soon.",Negative
48,"So Uber eats was having connectivity issues and pushed an order through to this location that was supposed to be cancelled. I know this isnt McDonald's fault, but when I called McDonalds to try and address the issue, they answered and then ignored me and must have left their phone off the hook because any attempt to call them after this got me only dial tone. I know places are short staffed, but you cant just ignore people.",Negative
49,"If I paid for a large-sized meal, and I asked for both a large fry and a large drink, please don't argue with me that the ticket says medium drink. Thank you so much from a single parent who just wanted to spend a little bit of money on unhealthy food for wasting my hard-earned money.",Negative
50,Customer  service  is no good the staff  play games  as if I'm there to pay my money  to see them horsing around. And the the management  are a jock don't answer  the phone . to night is September 29 2021 at 10:30pm my next  visit to Austin will not be to a McDonald's...,Negative
51,"My nuggets were way to salty and crunchy which means to had been sitting there a while, cashier cut me off in the middle of my order but was nice and polite when I addressed it and fries where kinda cold but another then good place to get food at an affordable price",Neutral
52,"Alright I know it was 5:25 in the morning when we came here and the worker was probably tired as hell. I will give him that for sure, but it was just odd pulling up to the machine and total silence. we had to say ""hello?"" before he came on and asked what we wanted. Was seemingly rude about it and not amazingly friendly. You do not have to sound peppy and full of life at 5am, but at least be nice..",Neutral
53,"waited in the drive through for over half an hour, all i got for my trouble was a ""sorry for the wait"" not even an explanation. When I got to the second window there were at least a dozen sodas just sitting on the counter. It's not the first time I've had bad service. I once pulled up and they just said we're not serving right now even though it was smack dab in the middle of the day hours.",Negative
54,"Service is slow, but I get all of my items with no errors and it's a bit smaller than most locations. Overall, it's a good place to grab a quick bite near Lake Creek.",Positive 
55,"The cashier's are very nice. Its very clean on the inside, and they get your food done fast",Positive 
56,Manager waited on me. He went out of his way to make me a satisfied customer.  Great customer service!,Positive 
57,2:42 AM on a Saturday and they just straight up stopped answering the drive through. They just sitting in there chilling,Negative
58,"I would have given 5 stars, the evening manager is the nicest person I have seen and is definitely in charge of training her crew with constantly new help, in spite of this, everytime I have to return an order she goes back to the kitchen and patiently disassembles the sandwich and explains the proper way to make the sandwich in a spirit of education and with a cherry disposition. You can tell the children she works with respect her and look up to her, and yes, they might get things confused occasionally but I will continue to go there. 4 out of 5 stars",Positive 
59,"The staff is very kind and the food is usually prepared in a timely manner, for this reason it'sone of my preferred location's. However the drive thru line can sometimes be an inconvenience as it can get very long and at times even block entrances.",Positive 
60,"Awful experience. Drive thru attendants are rude, untrained, and unprofessional. When asked for a manager the attendants lie and say that there isn't one on duty, FYI impossible for every shift not to have a manager. One specific attendant screamed and cursed at me, to which led me to contact corporate.",Negative
61,"Decent McDonald's location.  The team here has always been friendly.  Drive thru can get pretty backed up during normal meal periods, so often it is better to go inside.  Make sure you go close to regular meal periods for fresher food vs the ones under the heat lamp for a while.    Store is always clean.",Neutral
62,"Hashbrowns were fire today.

Frappes always on point and the machine is always working.

Always get me to work on time with fast workers",Positive 
63,"When I order during the day, I have zero issues. They are listed as a 24 hour location, so they show up on Uber Eats late at night. Anytime I order after midnight, they will accept my order through UE and then sit around for an hour before cancelling it. I don't understand why you list yourselves as a 24 hour location if you cancel any orders after midnight. Other than that, this place has always given great service.",Neutral
64,McDonalds is NOT a fast food company anymore. They're just a food company now. Always a line wrapped around the building that never moves. When are robots going to replace the kitchen staff who hate their jobs?,Negative
65,This McDonalds CONSTANTLY gets orders wrong. We have ordered at the window and over uber and EVERY SINGLE TIME we dont get a complete order. Today we went back to get our fry we had 3 chicken sandwiches and 2 fry not complicated at all. The manager gave us a new one but the girl at the oick up window shoved the bag in ny hands and when I tha ked her she made a rude face and turned away.,Negative
66,"Night time drive through team seem really unprofessional. I ordered a meal with an extra fry, but when I got to the food window, was only given the fry with the meal. I mentioned the extra fry and was told I only paid for 1 fry. I offered to pay the difference for the extra fry, but was told I needed to drive back around and order again. Seriously? That's the response? Will not be returning.",Negative
67,"Worst experience! All I asked for was a regular size coffee.I get to the window and was handed a small , I asked the woman if that was a regular to which she rudely said yes I questioned her again two more times then I asked her how many sizes of coffee they had she said small medium and large I asked her which one was the one I was holding and she said it's a small that's what we charged you for she said, and I told her I asked for a regular which would be a medium but I just drove off. Also asked for 3 splendas and 4 creamers on the side and received 3 regular sugars and 2 creamers. To top it off, coffee was full of coffee grounds to the point I was spitting them out. And as a little plus there was a piece of plastic! Never again!",Negative
68,"Attempted to go through the drive thru at 430 am. It said it was 24 hour, however no one seemed to be taking orders and I drove around twice just in case and tried again but still no answer. I saw one employee in the kitchen but couldn't get his attention.   Very bad business. If closed or delayed in opening then at least a sign that indicates that would have been nice.",Negative
69,"This place is okay. It has these kiosks where you order, take a number, and they bring the food to your table. I ordered a frozen lemonade, paid for it, then sat down. I was there for a bit before someone came and told me they were out. I got a regular drink instead but it was too much trouble to get a refund for the difference. I'm not sure I like this new way.",Neutral
70,"My burger was completely raw in the middle and when I took the burger back in to get it remade the lady behind the counter treated me like I was some stuck up brat for not wanting to eat a raw burger.
If I had the ability to give them a zero star rating I would. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!!",Negative
71,Allways has the best Fries and Ice cream in the world!,Positive 
72,Mcdonalds is great but they really need to hire people who understand both english and spanish and not just spanish speakers trying to take english orders. The people are really nice but be smarter about who you put in the drive thru and lobby to take orders.,Positive 
73,I love going to McDonald's in that area because that's where I get most of my food for my family and my grandchildren and they love me when I bring stuff to him like every couple days so it's great to go to that McDonald's McDonald's is a good spot for taking my grandkids and buy him food there are the greatest thing that they're right off of lake Creek thank you for putting it there,Positive 
74,I work for Doordash and when I go to pick up orders at night I spend 20 minutes of my time just waiting in the drive thru line. There has to be a easier way for this to get done.,Neutral
75,"Horrible customer service always gets my order wrong. They were out of French fries so I said that's fine I can wait while you make more. ""We can't do that"" seriously what kind of fast food place can't make fries? It only takes two minutes and 15 to heat up even the worst fryer. Which I would have waited for. Is this not the money making industry?

My business is now sitting at Whataburger who also doesn't have fries ready but said I could have some fresh in two minutes.",Negative
76,The most horrible service yet.  Drive thru can't get a dam thing right at all has no interest in his voice. I have to continue to repeat myself for you to still get it wrong. Then when I went through drive threw they still can't follow directions. So sad.,Negative
77,"I hate the new self ordering touchscreens. It can be hard to order even the simplest items.  Staff seemed preoccupied, did not even get my order correct. I had to ask for my parfait. Sweet tea was empty.",Negative
78,"Nothing! Staff was rude. No napkins out, tables were dirty. My son and I went in at 1050 to get lunch before a movie knowing lunch starts at 1030. They apparently don't serve lunch until 11. When I asked why she said because people like late breakfast on weekends. Why that affects lunch I don't know. According to the sign, breakfast is served all day. Had I read the reviews first I would have gone to the one across the highway.",Negative
79,"Your general fast food place with subpar service. Went here one morning to get a quick breakfast because we had no time for our usual Saturday morning spot. We ordered several different breakfast items and at the end my wife went to order a single order of three pancakes and sausage breakfast for one of the kids. At checkout it seemed expensive at first, the cashier never repeated the order back to us. When we received our order, we figured out why. She put us down for three total three pancakes and sausage breakfasts. When my wife brought it up the girl behind the register just said ""oops, sorry"" and walked away, no offer to fix it or give a refund. Great job.",Negative
80,"I didn't used to mind this McD's.  I was happy there was an option for 24-hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late-night munchies.  During the day, it's a pretty average McD's.  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am, pulled up to the order box, waited for five minutes, then finally someone came over the speaker and said ""Sorry we're closed"".

Closed?!  It's 24-hrs!  And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning.  I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you're not blind-sided by it.  Not this place.  I really don't think they were closed.  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.

Additionally, this store has a bad habit of having a ""broken"" ice cream machine past 10pm.  It's always ""sorry, ice cream machine is broken"" if you come in after the lobby closes.

The worst part is I complained on the website.  I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue.  All I got back (weeks later) was ""oh, sorry the ice cream machine was broken, we're working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time""  Not even a single MENTION of the ""closed"" 24-hr location.

As I said, it's a pretty standard McD's... which is synonymous with lazy, but this one takes the cake on it.",Negative
81,Love the price  French fries,Positive 
82,We went through the drive-through and ordered 2 bacon-cheese burgers and 2 big Mac's and we asked for them to leave the middle part (the bread in the center). We got the bacon-cheese burgers and they were fine. But the big Mac's not only still had the bread in the center but had another piece of bread on the bottom with mac-sause on them. So instead of 2 pieces of meat and 2 pieces of bread I ended with 2 pieces of meat and 4 pieces of bread. I was not amused when I got home. You can bet that I will NOT EVER stop there again.,Negative
83,I was very surprised to have come to this McDonalds while working this side of town .. Coffee was like drinking a cup of  hot water.. wow McDonalds has been known for its coffee. Not this one. Get a water instead.,Negative
84,"Always busy, sort of slow (but not too slow). Dangerous intersection, when leaving the drive thru. The food the couple of times I have been here seemed old or dry, it wasn't bad, just not very good.",Negative
85,All that I had ordered was two McDoubles and large soda. Both burgers were not just pink but Red in the center. Was the last time I have even TRIED eating fast food altogether.,Negative
86,Food was good atmosphere was ok restaurant was clean. Only thing from making it a 5 I almost ate it on the floor. Wet sign was present but it was beyond slick. Otherwise good quick place to grab a bite.,Positive 
87,"I am very dissatisfied with the service at this location. I asked for a #1 which is a big Mac instead they charged me for a quarter pounder. My son ordered a cheeseburger happy meal , he wanted the burger with mustard, onions, and pickles. My son was so upset and he refused to eat his food . The burger that I got slopply made and the meat was half way hanging out of the burger and it was so bad that it was almost dry. My little boy was so upset that he doesn't want to here any more. From a very mad Mommy and a hurt little boy",Negative
88,"Id only eat from here if there is no other option. Its on a good location since its kinda on my way from work to home. I finish work at 12am so i have literally no other option cause i am exhausted and not willing to drive further. Burgers are dry, patties are old, i got 4 nuggets instead of 6. In short, dont waste your money cook yourself at home.",Negative
89,"I found  pieces of hair in my food. I also had to  Pay for pancake syrup and ranch and when I open the bag they were already open and leaking into my bag.  When I called to make a complaint the manager   Did not answer it took 7 calls back-to-back an he was incredibly rude!  He told me that everyone there has passed their certification and if I don't like it I can go to the health department.  I have made a complaint with the  Texas health department. Floors are disgusting, bathrooms are disgusting!  This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my life and I have traveled all over this country.",Negative
90,"Compared to other Macdonald's locations, this is consistently the best. Polite, fast and overwhelming accurate on the orders. I've been going to this location for a while, never had a bad experience at the drive thru. Great staff!",Positive 
91,One star because everytime I go early in the morning this lady is always so rude. Granted I know its early but if u can't handle being up this early then maybe you should consider getting a different job. It's not okay to be rude.,Negative
92,Asked me to wait at spot one. Asked for jelly and was completely ignored. Had to go inside to get it myself. Trash customer service. I blame management for not holding anyone accountable.,Negative
93,seriously I had asked specifically no onion on both of my steak bagels meals when I got to my house they both had onions. and I had asked for picante sauce and they didn't even put sauce  packets in my bag. it just sucks getting home and not being able to eat what you expected.,Negative
94,"The inside smells like baby diapers. When you ask for extra sweet and sour sauce they give you a dirty look like it is such a hassle. The ice cream machine is always broken, and the food always looks like it was put together so carelessly. Guess you can't expect much from a McDonald's anyways.",Negative

96,They are always rude and get mad when they mess your order up I've never been to such a bad service place,Negative
97,"Seriously, what is the deal with not being able to brew fresh sweet tea? It's sad that you have to check your drinks before you leave the drive thru. It seems as if 3 time a week we get bad tea from this location. It's not like we can just leave work to go get a new one either. We send my hubby on a drink run in the morning and he constantly forgets to take the ""taste test"" before he leaves, but he should not have to!",Negative
98,I tried the spices chicken nugget sauce for the first time. It was like a thick Tabasco and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would! I ate that instead of my burger.,Neutral
99,They tried to sell me 2 hashbrowns for $3 when it clearly says 3 for $3 on the drive thru menu . im already mad with myself for going there in the first place. But im in a rush this morning. So i get to the window after showing the pic they still say so you want 2 and 1 extra? Oh i snapped. Then i asked how much is one hashbrown. He said $1 ohhhh i snapped lol so the deal is you get to pay a extra $1 for 2 ? So i just said give me 3 $ hashbrowns. Then they said its tax.. I wanted to jump out of my brand new suv .. Lol i now see why they have those videos of people jumping on fast food workers! So i gave them my card and call the manager and he was just as smart as them. Armando said we do have sandwiches for $3. I almost threw my phone. I said i never asked you about a sandwich i said hashbrowns. Smh then i just said good bye sir you'll be hearing from me again. But really wants the use. I made that bad decision,Negative
100,Much cleaner after the renovations and the quality of food for a mcdonalds is better as well. The staff has been relatively friendly and with the new atmosphere im more likely to eat inside rather than the drive thru.,Positive

OLD: They took out all the power outlets and a table was just left broken covered with caution tape. Always understaffed and you can tell the owners are sucking this place for every penny without putting anything back in. Gives family owned McDonald's a bad name.",Positive

108,Meh! It's McDonald's what can I say you get what you pay for. Don't expect the place to be clean or the employees to be over the moon with courtesy. Like I said you get what you pay for. This is not a bad review it's just a Meh review because it's McDonalds. It's not like you're eating at a five-star Resort and getting a massage afterwards. However if McDonald's does decide one of these days to start serving alcohol I might have to pay it another visit. I don't go to McDonald's often. I only stopped in out of convenience. Like I said this is not a bad review to disrespect McDonald's in any way.,Neutral
